                <h1>Disgust is the green character and one of the five Emotions inside the mind of Riley, along with Joy, Fear, Anger, and Sadness. Mindy Kaling describes her as follows: "Disgust is very protective of Riley. She has high expectations for everyone around her and isn't very patient.
                  <br><br>
                  Anger feels very passionately about making sure things are fair for Riley. He has a fiery spirit and tends to explode (literally) when things don't go as planned. He is quick to overreact and has little patience for life's imperfections. And we often feel and show it whenever we feel things do not go as planned. And if someone pisses us off.
