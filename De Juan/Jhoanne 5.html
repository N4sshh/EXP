                <h2>
                    Here is our family. We are the Legarde & De Juan family with four Marias: Mary John, Marjorie, Mary Joy, and Mary Jhoanne. Our names are a combination of our parents' names, Mardy and Joseph (M&J). Our parents, nanay and tatay, fulfill their responsibilities in sustaining our needs and providing for our wants. My father is a family driver, and my mother serves as a Barangay Health Worker and Motherbatler in our church. Our family is a happy one, and I cherish my parents dearly. We are fortunate to have loving and selfless parents.
