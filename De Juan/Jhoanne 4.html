                  He is Khenan Alvin Dimapindan Octavio, he is 19 years old. He is currently a 2nd year college student taking up Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering at University of Iloilo. He is my high school crush, we've become friends for more than 2 years when we are in ninth grade. After our two years of being best friends, we decided to become more than friends since we love each other. And now we are going to become 4 years on September 14 this year. As young lovers and both being the eldest in the family, sometimes we don't understand each other. But we are mature enough to fix our problems instead of ending our relationship. He is a good boyfriend to me. He is willing to do things that make me happy, and all I want is to be with him in the future to successfully achieve our goals and desires in life.
