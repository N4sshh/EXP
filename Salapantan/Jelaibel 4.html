                  The Seven Deadly Sins「七つの大罪, Nanatsu no Taizai」 are the strongest and cruelest order of Holy Knights in the Kingdom of Liones. They were formed by seven brutal criminals, who had all been convicted for grievous crimes and had carved the symbols of seven beasts onto their bodies.[1] They are the titular main protagonists of the first series.
