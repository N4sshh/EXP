                <h1>Like Keroppi, initially Pompompurin was created through an in-house contest held by Sanrio in 1996 to design a new dog character. His design was the most popular and ended up winning the contest.

                  <br>Sometime afterwards, he debuted in the 1996 July issue of Strawberry News with his original name being Boku, Pudding, but it got changed later on to his current name. In 1997, the first year he was included in the Sanrio Character Ranking, he won first place.
